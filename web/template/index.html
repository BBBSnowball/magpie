    <H1>Welcome to Magpie!</H1>
    <p class=lead>
    I <b><i>love</i></b> <a target=_blank href=https://evernote.com>Evernote</a>
    , but I just don't trust anybody with data I care about anymore, so I
    decided to try to build a replacement I could host myself.  Magpie is an
    Evernote replacement which renders Markdown, is backed by git, and is built
    on Python.
